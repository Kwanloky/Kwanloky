### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there and I will introduce myself by code:


```python
#!/usr/bin/python

class DylanStarship:

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = ["Dylan", "Junluo CHEN"]
        self.researcher = True
        self.weapon = ["causal inference", "behavioral economics"]
        self.focus = ["healthcare", "AI in organization"]

    def biu(self):
        print("I'm glad you read my intro! Please also visit my website chen-junluo.com")


me = DylanStarship()
me.biu()
```
